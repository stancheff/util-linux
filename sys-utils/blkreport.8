zoned devices that support the ZAC or ZBC command set.
.PP
By default,
.B blkreport
will report from the start of the block device upto 512k bytes of the
zone report (~8160 zones].  Options may be used to modify

The number of bytes to allocate for the report from the block device.
The provided value will be aligned to the device sector size.
If the specified value will be limited to the range of 512 bytes to 512 k-bytes.

.I offset
and
.IR length .
