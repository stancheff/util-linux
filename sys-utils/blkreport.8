.TH BLKREPORT 5 "March 2016" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
blkreport \- report zones on a device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blkreport
[options]
.RB [ \-o
.IR offset ]
.RB [ \-l
.IR report length ]
.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blkreport
is used to report device zone information.  This is useful for
zoned devices that support the ZAC or ZBC command set.
Unlike
.BR sg_rep_zones (8) ,
this command is can be used on any block device.
.PP
By default,
.B blkreport
will report from the start of the block device upto 512k bytes of the
zone report (~8160 zones].  Options may be used to modify
this behavior based on the starting zone or size of the report,
as explained below.
.PP
The
.I device
argument is the pathname of the block device.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The
.I zone
and
.I length
arguments may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is
optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes
KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
.TP
.BR \-z , " \-\-zone \fIoffset"
The starting zone to be reported on on specified as a sector offset.
The provided offset in sector units should match the start of a zone.
The default value is zero.
.TP
.BR \-l , " \-\-length \fIlength"
The number of bytes to allocate for the report from the block device.
The provided value will be aligned to the device sector size.
If the specified value will be limited to the range of 512 bytes to 512 k-bytes.
.TP
.BR \-e , " \-\-endian \fInum"
Assume report is in 0->little endian or 1->big endian format and disable
the endian guessing.
.TP
.BR \-F , " \-\-force"
Force report to by-pass the zone cache and query the media. If the zone
cache is available it will be updated with the results of the report.
.TP
.BR \-r , " \-\-option"
Zoned devices support various reports. The default report lists all zones,
however more specific reports can be specified. Available reports are:
.BR 0 \- non seq. and reset (default)
.BR 1 \- empty
.BR 2 \- open implicit
.BR 3 \- open explicit
.BR 4 \- closed
.BR 5 \- full
.BR 6 \- read only
.BR 7 \- offline
.BR 0x10 \- reset
.BR 0x11 \- non sequential
.BR 0x3f \- non write pointer zones
.TP
.BR \-v , " \-\-verbose"
Display the aligned values of
.I offset
and
.IR length .
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display help text and exit.
