.SH NAME
blkreset \- Reset a range of zones
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blkreset
[options]
.RB [ \-z
.IR zone ]
.RB [ \-c
.IR count ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blkreset
is used to reset one or more zones.  This is useful for
zoned devices that support the ZAC or ZBC command set.
Unlike
.BR sg_reset_wp (8) ,
this command operates from the block layer and can reset a range of zones.
.PP
By default,
.B blkreset
will operate on the zone at device logical sector 0. Options may be used to
modify this behavior as well as specify the operation to be performed on
the zone, as explained below.
.PP
The
.I device
argument is the pathname of the block device.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The
.I zone
argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is
optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes
KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
Additionally the common 0x prefix can be used to specify zone and length in hex.
.TP
.BR \-z , " \-\-zone \fIoffset" , " \-\-offset \fIoffset"
The starting zone to be operated upon specified as a sector offset.
The provided offset in sector units (512 bytes) should match the start of a zone.
The default value is zero.
.TP
.BR \-c , " \-\-count \fIcount" , " \-\-length \fIcount"
The number of zones to be reset starting from offset. Default is 1 zone.
