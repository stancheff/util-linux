.TH BLKRESET 5 "October 2016" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
blkreset \- Reset a range of zones
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B blkreset
[options]
.RB [ \-z
.IR zone ]
.RB [ \-c
.IR number of zones ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B blkreset
is used to reset a zone.  This is useful for
zoned devices that support the ZAC or ZBC command set.
Unlike
.BR sg_reset_wp (8) ,
this command operates from the block layer and can reset a range of zones.
.PP
By default,
.B blkreset
will operate on the zone at device logical sector 0. Options may be used to
modify this behavior as well as specify the operation to be performed on
the zone, as explained below.
.PP
The
.I device
argument is the pathname of the block device.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The
.I zone
argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is
optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes
KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
As zones were originally required to be sized as a power of 2 logical
sectors this still is the most common layout. The 0x prefix can also be
used to specify the zone to be operated on.
.TP
.BR \-z , " \-\-zone \fIoffset"
The zone to be operated on specified as a sector offset.
The provided offset in sector units should match the start of a zone.
The default value is zero.
.TP
.BR \-c , " \-\-count \fIzones"
The number of zones to be reset starting from offset.
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version"
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
